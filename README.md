# Data Warehouse & Analytics Project (PostgreSQL)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Data Warehouse and analytical workflows using PostgreSQL.
It covers the process from data extraction to transformation and loading (ETL), followed by creating analytical queries for business insights.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a data warehouse schema (Star or Snowflake schema).

- Integrate data from multiple sources (CSV, Excel, or external databases).

- Implement ETL processes directly in PostgreSQL using SQL and scripts.

- Perform advanced analytics with PostgreSQL functions and window queries.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- PostgreSQL (Database & ETL using COPY and SQL scripts)

- SQL (DDL, DML, Analytical Queries)

- CSV / Excel (Source data)

- Power BI / Tableau (Optional visualization)

## 🚀 Features
- Dimensional Modeling (Star schema with Fact and Dimension tables)

- ETL Pipeline to clean, transform, and load data into warehouse tables

- Aggregated Reports for KPIs

- Sample Analytical Queries (Trends, comparisons, rankings, growth analysis)

 ## 📊 Example Queries
- Top 10 products by sales

- Year-over-year revenue growth

- Regional sales performance

- Customer purchase frequency

## 📦 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mauricebongani/data-warehouse-sqlserver.git
2. Restore the SQL Server database from schema/ scripts.

3. Run ETL processes to populate the warehouse.

4. Execute queries in queries/ for analytics.
