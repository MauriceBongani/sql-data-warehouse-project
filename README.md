# Data Warehouse & Analytics Project (SQL Server)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Data Warehouse** and analytical workflows using **SQL Server**.  
It covers the process from **data extraction** to **transformation** and **loading (ETL)**, followed by creating analytical queries for business insights.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a **data warehouse schema** (Star/Snowflake schema).
- Integrate data from multiple sources.
- Implement ETL processes.
- Perform advanced analytics with SQL Server.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server** (Database & ETL using SQL Server Integration Services - SSIS)
- **SQL** (DDL, DML, Analytical Queries)
- **Excel / CSV** (Data Sources)
- **Power BI** (Optional visualization)

## 🚀 Features
- **Dimensional Modeling** (Star schema with Fact and Dimension tables)
- **ETL Pipeline** to clean and load data
- **Aggregated Reports** for KPIs
- **Sample Analytical Queries** (Trends, comparisons, rankings)

## 📊 Example Queries
- Top 10 products by sales
- Year-over-year revenue growth
- Regional sales performance

## 📦 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mauricebongani/data-warehouse-sqlserver.git
2. Restore the SQL Server database from schema/ scripts.

3. Run ETL processes to populate the warehouse.
